#Configuring TrueNAS Network

To ensure TrueNAS communicates correctly with your NAT configuration:

Go to TrueNAS Web Interface:

Navigate to Network > Global Configuration to ensure DNS, gateway, and IP addresses are correctly set.
Set Static IP:

Assign a static IP to TrueNAS under Network > Interfaces (e.g., 192.168.1.50).
Test Connectivity:

Ensure TrueNAS can access the internet and the outside world through your NAT firewall by pinging external resources (use the shell to run ping 8.8.8.8).
