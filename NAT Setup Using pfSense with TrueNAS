#NAT Setup Using pfSense with TrueNAS

If you're using pfSense (an open-source firewall) to provide NAT functionality for your TrueNAS system, here's a basic configuration approach.

Set Up pfSense: Ensure pfSense is installed and configured as your firewall/router. It will manage NAT between your internal network (TrueNAS and other devices) and the external internet.

Assign IP Addresses:

TrueNAS should have a static private IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.50).
Ensure that pfSense provides NAT for traffic from the TrueNAS IP.
Sample pfSense NAT Setup:
Here’s a quick step-by-step for setting up NAT in pfSense for TrueNAS:

Log in to pfSense:

Navigate to your pfSense web interface (https://192.168.1.1 or your configured address).
Go to Firewall > NAT:

Under the "Firewall" menu, click "NAT" and go to the "Port Forward" tab.
Add a New Port Forward Rule:

Interface: WAN (External interface).
Protocol: TCP/UDP (depending on your service, e.g., SSH, HTTP, SMB).
Destination Address: The WAN IP (external IP or interface address).
Destination Port Range: Ports used for TrueNAS services (e.g., port 22 for SSH, 445 for SMB).
Redirect Target IP: The private IP of your TrueNAS box (e.g., 192.168.1.50).
Redirect Target Port: The corresponding port on your TrueNAS system.
Description: Label the rule (e.g., TrueNAS SSH).
Save the Configuration:

Click Save and then Apply Changes.
Test the NAT:

Verify if NAT is working by trying to access your TrueNAS services externally through the forwarded port.
Example of Port Forwarding for SMB/SSH:
TrueNAS IP: 192.168.1.50
External WAN IP: 203.0.113.1
Service: SSH on port 22, SMB on port 445.

SHELL
Destination: 203.0.113.1:22 → Redirect to: 192.168.1.50:22
Destination: 203.0.113.1:445 → Redirect to: 192.168.1.50:445
