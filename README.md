- Introduction
- This repository is a collection of scripts, configurations, and examples designed to enhance the security of network infrastructure. It includes practical examples of deep packet inspection, exploit mitigation, traffic shaping, and more, particularly in environments using TrueNAS and pfSense.

### Features
- TrueNAS network configuration guides.
- Deep packet inspection (DPI) techniques.
- Vulnerability detection scripts.
- Packet crafting and obfuscation methods.
- Example integration setups for TrueNAS with pfSense.
- SQL-based defense mechanisms.
- Logging and alerting functionality for enhanced monitoring.
Prerequisites
- TrueNAS: Required for implementing the configuration guides.
- pfSense: For NAT setup and network-level obfuscation.
- C++ Compiler: Required for compiling the .cpp scripts.
- SQL Database: To utilize defense.sql for data storage and security.
  
### Installation
- Clone the repository:
- bash
- Copy code
